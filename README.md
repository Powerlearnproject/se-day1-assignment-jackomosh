#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answers:

Software Engineering is the ability to systematically apply engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain software solutions.
Software engineering in the technology industry has enabled us to come up with software application and systems that can be used in various industries
such as the education system. Through software applications, learners can access information and learning materials online and basically learn from anywhere.
And this has encouraged those in remote areas to develop in terms of skills and knowledge aquisition.

The technology industry has also benefited from software engineering through the creation of job opportunities and this has made the industry to
grow and expand due to innovation and invention in the software space.

Another Importance of software engineering in technology is that, through the development of certain programs and systems such as automation, the time taken to do a task
manually in a tech ecosystems has reduced therefore saving time, energy and resources that would rather be required.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answers: 

The development of programming languages - The evolution of programming languages has not only made software development more efficient and accessible but has also spurred innovation and adaptability within the industry. This ongoing development continues to shape the future of technology.

The introduction of software engineering as a discipline - The rise of software engineering has led to the incorporation of programming and software development into academic curricula. This includes not just technical skills but also project management, Application development, user experience design, and systems analysis and design therefore creating jobs in the universities and colleges and also in the job market.

The rise of agile methodologies and systems - Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility and adaptability. This allows development teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and market conditions, leading to more relevant and user-focused software products.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answers:

1. Requirements - This is the process of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design - This is process of creating user interface and designing high level software architecture
3. Implementation - This is the process of writing the code and building the software according to design specifics.
4. Testing - After designing, we now test our software to ensure that it meets quality standards and functions as intended.
5. Deployment - This involves realising the software to users and customers
6. Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answers:

Waterfall methodology refers to a step by step sequential approach to software development while agile methodology refers to an iteractive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change in software development

We could use waterfall methodology where we are building healthcare systems that complies with strict regulations where in we could use agile methodologies when developing an e-commerce website with features that need to adapt to user preferences and seasonal trends enabling continuous updates and improvements. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Answers:

Software developer roles - Design and Development: Software developers are responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions. This involves writing clean, efficient code, selecting appropriate technologies, and ensuring that the software meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

Quality Assurance Engineer - Designs and Executes test plans.

Project Manager - To oversee the palnning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answers:

IDEs help users to write test and debug code. This is an important software since engineers can work develop software without the need of building there own IDEs. Example of such a tool is the Visual Studio Code.

VCS hepl engineers to store, access and collaborate with others on the same software. This is also important because engineers can work together on the same project without having to have their team members source code or computer. Example of this tool is Git & Github.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Answers:

Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and thus  compromise quality of software.

Change in specifications: Often users change what the require from the software products and this can lead to delayed projects.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Answers:

Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software this is important in software development since engineers are able to differentiate which component is working or has isuues that needs debuging at an earlier stage.

Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. This will ensure that components work together as intended, helping to catch interface-related issues that unit testing might miss.

System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. It helps identify issues in the software that may arise from interactions between various components or from other unforseen factors.

Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This is important as it confirms that the product fulfills the needs of stakeholders and users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answer:

Prompt Engineering is the process of organising input that is clear, direct and relevant to what engineers require from AI Models. It is a crucial skill for maximizing the utility of AI language models, enabling users to generate more accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer:

Prompt 1. What is software engineering
Prompt 2. Define software engineering using real life examples to a 5 year old kid.
